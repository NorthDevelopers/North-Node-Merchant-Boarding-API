# Automate Merchant Onboarding in a NodeJS App
This is a JavaScript application that uses Node.js to demonstrate programmatic merchant onboarding for a Merchant Processing Account using North's [Merchant Boarding API](https://developer.north.com/products/fintech-tools/merchant-boarding-api). The code in this repository handles the front and back-end processes for creating a new Merchant ID (MID) application, updating it, and submitting it to North for Underwriting.

## Get Sandbox Credentials
To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.north.com/register). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Log in to your account to view the official [Merchant Boarding API Integration Guide](https://developer.north.com/products/fintech-tools/merchant-boarding-api/integration-guide), then [contact](https://developer.north.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
