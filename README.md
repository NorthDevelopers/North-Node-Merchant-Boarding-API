# Automate Merchant Onboarding in a NodeJS App
This is a JavaScript application that uses Node.js to demonstrate programmatic merchant onboarding for a Merchant Processing Account using Payments Hub's [Merchant Boarding API](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/fintech-tools/merchant-boarding-api). The code in this repository handles the front and back-end processes for creating a new Merchant ID (MID) application, updating it, and submitting it to Payments Hub for Underwriting.

## Get Sandbox Credentials
To get started, create a free [Payments Hub Developer Portal account](https://developer.paymentshub.com/auth/signup). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Log in to your account to view the official [Merchant Boarding API Integration Guide](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/fintech-tools/merchant-boarding-api/integration), then [contact](https://developer.paymentshub.com/contact) the Payments Hub Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
